# jTessBoxEditorCut
Fork of jTessBoxEditor adding a feature to save separate cropped images of recognized characters from training.
In the Box Editor tab, clicking on Cut Images will save your characters in separate images. This can be useful for training neural networks, boosting, etc.

Currently only confirmed to run in IntelliJ on macOS.

You can invert the images by commenting out lines 1520-1524 in Gui.java.
